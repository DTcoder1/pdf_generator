    "summary": "We present an end-to-end blueprint for deploying transparent NLP systems under real-world constraints. The framework couples drift-aware evaluation, rationale capture with evidence linking, and a governance checklist that operationalizes risk controls across data lineage, safety testing, change management, and rollback. We benchmark across five domains (civic discourse, healthcare notes, finance, education, and cultural heritage) and four model families with both in-domain and out-of-domain partitions. The approach yields improved calibration, lower hallucination rates, and clearer failure boundaries while maintaining reproducibility through open artifacts. We discuss cost/latency trade-offs, human factors, and practical pathways for adoption in regulated settings.",

        "Large-scale language models have accelerated adoption in knowledge work, but their deployment raises demands for transparency, safety, and governance across changing data distributions [1, 3, 9]. Early milestones in statistical NLP and attention mechanisms enabled compositional reasoning but left open questions about legibility and auditability in production [3, 5–7]. We argue for a practical blueprint that joins drift-aware evaluation, structured rationale capture, and explicit risk controls aligned with organizational processes [8, 11, 14].",
        "This paper contributes: (i) an evaluation suite with time/topic drift splits and bootstrap confidence intervals; (ii) an evidence-linked rationale protocol to surface model grounds without exposing sensitive content; and (iii) a governance checklist mapping model capabilities to risk exposure, including red-team coverage, rollback, and data lineage [9, 10, 11, 20]."

The governance layer enforces policy artifacts: risk registers, content filters, incident runbooks, and rollback triggers [11, 14, 20].",
